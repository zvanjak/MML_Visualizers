Welcome to octplot.

octplot is free software. Please see the file COPYING for details. For 
documentation, please see the files in the doc subdirectory. 
(currently no useful files).

In this release, there is no install target, so compile octplot, and 
then cd to the "src" directory. From there run the "setup_octplot" 
script. Now  you can try all the "m" files. Example:

h=plot(sin( (0:10000)/10000*2*pi));
set(h,"linestyle","--","marker","o");

most of the m files ar documented, so try using help on them you can zoom with the left mouse button, 
and unzoom (autoscale) with the right mouse button

Enjoy, and report the numerous bugs you find to me at sourceforge.

==================================================

Prequisites:

of course octave is needed to run (not to compile though, except for 
the oct files). I recommend using octave version >= 2.1.50. Octplot 
also requires octave-forge, currently only for the dispatch function, 
but in the future, I will make use of many more functions from 
octave-forge. I recommend octave-forge >= 2004.07.07 because it has a 
superior dispatch function.

Octplot relies on fltk (tested with fltk-1.1.4) compiled with OpenGL 
support. fltk is available from www.fltk.org and in binary form for a 
lot of platforms (I know of redhat, fedora, cygwin)  If you are 
compiling fltk from source, be sure to enable OpenGL support in fltk 
by runing fltk's configure with at least the "--enable-gl" flag before 
compiling it i.e.: 

cd fltk-1.1.4
./configure --enable-gl
make
make install

LINUX:

you might also want to add "--enable-xft" if your system supports it
for nicer fonts, but this is not essential. If you don't have OpenGL
support from your graphics card, use MESA www.mese.org to get software
OpenGL. Most recent Linux distributions include MESA.

If you do use MESA, set the GL_SWAP_TYPE enviroment variable to COPY
to overcome some bugs and improve preformance

WINDOWS:

Your octave distribution must support oct file creation
(i.e. mkoctfile must exist and do something usefull). I compiled
octave-2.1.50 under cygwin with the "--enable-shared" flag and all
works well for me (I have WinXP pro when not in Linux).

You will need some sort of cygwin installation to compile
octplot. fltk does come with cygwin, but I'm not sure it is configured
correctly. If octplot's configure script fails, follow the instruction
above on compiling fltk but add the "--enable-cygwin" flag to
configure i.e.:

cd fltk-1.1.4
./configure --enable-gl --enable-cygwin
make
make install

MAC:

fltk and octave both support the mac. Paul Keinzle reports no
particular problem compiling using fltk 1.1.5rc1. If you are having problems intaracting with the window, try issuing
fltk-config --post src/octplt. This will be done automatically in future releases (>0.1.5)
