Welcome to octplot.

octplot is free software. Please see the file COPYING for details. For
documentation, please see the files in the doc
subdirectory. (currently no useful files).

In this release, there is no install target, so compile octplot, and
then cd to the "src" directory. From there run the "setup_octplot"
script. Now you can try all the "m" files. Example:

############################################
## first, setup octplot
setup_octplot

## simple sin with line property settings
h=plot(sin( (0:10000)/10000*2*pi),"b-");

## change line style and add markers -- might be slow since there are
## 1e4 data points
set(h,"linestyle","--","marker","o");

## now change x-axis to log
set(gca(),"XScale","log");

## now make an eps hardcopy
print("demo.eps");

###############################################
## freqz plot (requires octave-forge for butter.m)
## shows off subplots
[b,a]=butter(5,[0.4,0.6],"stop");
freqz(b,a);

##############################################
## simple contour plot
clf();
[x,y]=meshgrid(-2:.2:2, -2:.2:3); 
z = x.*exp(-x.^2 - y.^2);
contour(x,y,z);
grid("on");

try zooming using the left mouse button, zoom-out using the right
mouse button, double click to transfer curentmouse coords to
clipboard. press "g" to toggle grid

for help on object properties try:
help figure_props
help axes_props
help line_props
help text_props

Enjoy, and report the numerous bugs you find to me at sourceforge.

==================================================

Prequisites:

of course octave is needed to run (not to compile though, except for
the oct files). I recommend using octave version >= 2.1.50. Octplot
also requires octave-forge, currently only for the dispatch function,
but in the future, I will make use of many more functions from
octave-forge. I recommend octave-forge >= 2004.07.07 because it has a
superior dispatch function.

Octplot relies on fltk (tested with fltk-1.1.4) compiled with OpenGL
support. fltk is available from www.fltk.org and in binary form for a
lot of platforms (I know of redhat, fedora, cygwin) If you are
compiling fltk from source, be sure to enable OpenGL support in fltk
by runing fltk's configure with at least the "--enable-gl" flag before
compiling it i.e.:

cd fltk-1.1.4
./configure --enable-gl
make
make install

LINUX:

you might also want to add "--enable-xft" if your system supports it
for nicer fonts, but this is not essential. If you don't have OpenGL
support from your graphics card, use MESA www.mese.org to get software
OpenGL. Most recent Linux distributions include MESA.

If you do use MESA, set the GL_SWAP_TYPE enviroment variable to COPY
to overcome some bugs and improve preformance

WINDOWS:

Your octave distribution must support oct file creation
(i.e. mkoctfile must exist and do something usefull). I compiled
octave-2.1.50 under cygwin with the "--enable-shared" flag and all
works well for me (I have WinXP pro when not in Linux).

You will need some sort of cygwin installation to compile
octplot. fltk does come with cygwin, but I'm not sure it is configured
correctly. If octplot's configure script fails, follow the instruction
above on compiling fltk but add the "--enable-cygwin" flag to
configure i.e.:

cd fltk-1.1.4
./configure --enable-gl --enable-cygwin
make
make install

MAC:

fltk and octave both support the mac. Paul Keinzle reports no
particular problem compiling using fltk 1.1.5rc1.
