Release notes for 0.2.0

Major new features in this release:

* subplots -- look at subplot.m
* log axis -- look at loglog.m, semilogx.m, semilogy.m
* contour -- look at contour.m
* missing value support using NaN
* better auto ticks
* better eps output -- look at print.m

RoadMap:

Release 0.2.5 

mainly a bug fixing release 


Release 0.3.0

The "Text release": Axis labels, tick marks, legends, and titles should
work flawlessly. This includes a complete overhaul of the text object:

* move to the FTGL rendering library for rotateable, anti-alised fonts.
* adding a "femtoTeX" parser which will parse at least the following
TeX constructs: ^ _ {} \Alpha-\Zeta \alpha-\zeta

These enhancements will affect all text objects including axis labels,
titles, and tick marks


Release 0.3.5 

mainly a bug fixing release 


Release 0.4.0

The "2D release": I will add all the missing 2d functionality -- patch
objects and the following functions

patch, piechart, bar, area

maybe arrow and errorbar


Release 0.4.5 

mainly a bug fixing release. 

At this point octplot should prove to be a viable alternative to gnuplot
for 2d graphs
